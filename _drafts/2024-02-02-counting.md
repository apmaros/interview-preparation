Counting can also be understood as tracking the frequency of something. Typically,  a frequency of a character or integer in sequence. As an algorithmic use case for counting would be using a sliding window.

> Example 1: You are given a string s and an integer k. Find the length of the longest substring that contains at most k distinct characters.
>
> For example, given s = "eceba" and k = 2, return 3. The longest substring with at most 2 distinct characters is "ece".

from collections import defaultdict

def longest_substring(s: str, k: int):
    counts = defaultdict(int)

    left = result = 0
    
    for right, c in enumerate(s):
        counts[c] += 1

        while len(counts) > k:
            sl = s[left]
            counts[sl] -= 1
            if counts[sl] == 0:
                del counts[sl]

            left += 1

        result = max(result, right - left)

    return result
