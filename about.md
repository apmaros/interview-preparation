Hi There!

I am a curious experienced software engineer curious about distributed systems and data processing.

You can find here notes from books, articles, or meetings I have attended over the years.

Send me a message on linkedin (<https://www.linkedin.com/in/maros-korinek/>) , or have a look at my code on Github (<https://github.com/apmaros>)
