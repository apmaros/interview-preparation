# Interview Structure

1. Read thoroughly the task
2. state the constrains and edge cases
3. Walk the example
4. Make sure you understand the task and the examples
    - ask questions if not
5. Try to come up with a brute force solution
6. Once you know the brute force, try to come up with more efficient solution

There are some patterns that lead to improvements:
  1. array is sorted
  2. array is not sorted but default solution would be n^2
  3. using 2 pointers to iterate the array
  4. frequency of elements in the array is related to solution - we could utilise additional memory - e.g. using set, or hashmap
