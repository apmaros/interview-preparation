# Distributed Systems Solution Architect

## Who I wanna be
-   distributed system engineer
-   providing solutions
-   comfortable delivering end-to-end solutions
-   comfortable designing and complex leading end-to-end solutions
 
## Data Structures
-   hashing
-   hashing and partitioning techniques e.g. consistency hashing
	-   [https://ably.com/blog/implementing-efficient-consistent-hashing](https://ably.com/blog/implementing-efficient-consistent-hashing)
-   CRDTs and another distributed systems

Common distributed data stores
-   Cassandra
-   Riak
-   Dynamo
-   Couchbase Server
-   Chubby
-   Dynamo db

Gossip protocols and consensus
-   Gossip protocol
-   Paxos protocol
-   Raft consensus algorithm
-   Popular consensus backed systems like [etcd](https://github.com/coreos/etcd) and [Zookeeper](https://zookeeper.apache.org/), and gossip backed systems like [Serf](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=serf+gossip&oq=serf+gossip&aqs=chrome..69i57.2442j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)



## Network protocols
-   [DNS](https://ably.com/blog/practical-strategies-for-dns-failure) protocol and UDP for address lookup
-   File descriptors (on unix) and buffers used for connections, NAT tables, conntrack tables etc.
-   IP to route packets between hosts
-   TCP to establish a connection
-   TLS handshakes, termination and certificate authentication
-   HTTP/1.1 or more recently 2.0 used extensively by gRPC
-   what about HTTP 3.0?
-   WebSocket upgrades over HTTP
    
What are current trends technologies and methods in the cutting edge?
