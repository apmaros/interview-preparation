# Rate Limiter


## Clarification
1. Client side vs Server side rate limiter?
2. Is the rate limiting based on IP, or User ID?
3. What is the scale of the system?
4. Will the system work in a distributed environment?
5. Is the rate limiter a independent service or it should be part of application code?
6. Do users need to be informed that they are being throttled or not?
